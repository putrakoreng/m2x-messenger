<h2>An overview of the project</h2>
<p>M2X Messenger is based on a modified version of OpenYMSG. It implements a Yahoo! Instant Messenger Client for Android. The motivation behind its development was the lack of open source Yahoo! clients for Android and my attempt to learn Android software development.</p>
<p>The project is currently on its Beta release and is stable enough for daily use. Many features have been added since the early Alpha releases and you can now enjoy a feature rich open source Yahoo! messenger. Also bear in mind that the minimum SDK required to run it is v8 (Android 2.1 and above). The latest version features a completely new UI design which should be compatible with various screen densities.</p>

<li>Yahoo! smiley support</li>
<li>Customizable alerts and notifications</li>
