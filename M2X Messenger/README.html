<h2>An overview of the project</h2>
<p>M2X Messenger is based on OpenYMSG (well a slightly modified version of it to be 
    precise). It implements a Yahoo! Instant Messenger Client for Android. The 
    motivation behind its development was the lack of open source Yahoo! clients for 
    Android and my attempt to learn Android software development.</p>
    <p>The project is still on its very Alpha release but should be stable enough for 
        daily use. Many features are still missing but the core features required to use 
        Yahoo! Instant Messaging casually, are present. Also bear in mind that the 
        minimum SDK required to run it is v11 (Android 2.3 and above)</p>
    <p>To represent the branch and to acknowledge the original author(s)
for his work, <code>@author</code> javadoc tags have been included in
the orignal source files, and direct derivations thereof. </p>
